The Challenge - Building xxd
In this Coding Challenge we’re going to build a clone of xxd. We’ll use it to create some hexdumps and to convert them back to binary. While we’re at it we’ll learn a little about binary files.

Step Zero
Like most programming languages, Coding Challenges is zero indexed!

For this step, Please ready your IDE / development environment of choice and prepare an new project in your programming language of choice. It’s a program your own adventure!

After that here’s what I’d like you to do to be ready to test your solution. As we did in the build your own tar coding challenge we’re going to use a tarball as an example, you can create it by running the following commands:

echo "File 1 contents" >> file1.txt
echo "File 2 contents" >> file2.txt
echo "File 3 contents" >> file3.txt
tar -cf files.tar file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
Step 1
In this step your goal is to dump a tarball as hex. To do this you’ll need to open the file in binary mode, read it in and dump the contents to standard out as hex.

By default xxd prints the output in three sections. The first is the offset into the file, the second is the data as hex and the third is the data as text. There are 16 bytes per line. That will look like this:

% ccxxd files.tar | head -n 10
00000000: 6669 6c65 312e 7478 7400 0000 0000 0000  file1.txt.......

00000070: 3635 2000 3030 3030 3234 2000 3030 3030  65 .000024 .0000

I’ve used head to only show the first ten lines for brevity.

Step 2
In this step your goal is to support changing the output to little-endian (-e flag). Using this option treats the byte groups as words in little-endian byte order. The default grouping of four bytes is used unless a different grouping is specified with the -g flag.

This looks like:

% ccxxd -e files.tar | head -n 2
00000000: 656c6966 78742e31 00000074 00000000   file1.txt.......
00000010: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000   ................
And:

% ccxxd -e -g 8 files.tar | head -n 2
00000000: 78742e31656c6966 0000000000000074   file1.txt.......
00000010: 0000000000000000 0000000000000000   ................
Don’t forget to handle invalid values for -g.

Step 3
In this step your goal is to support the command line options to set the number of octets to be written out and the number of columns to print per line. These are the -l and -c flags in you want to explore the valid settings in the man entry.

For example:

% ccxxd -l 16 files.tar 
00000000: 6669 6c65 312e 7478 7400 0000 0000 0000  file1.txt.......

% ccxxd -l 16 -c 4 files.tar 
00000000: 6669 6c65  file
00000004: 312e 7478  1.tx
00000008: 7400 0000  t...
0000000c: 0000 0000  ....
Step 4
In this step your goal is to support the -s flag which allows us to seek to a specific byte offset in the file. For example in the build your own tar challenge we learned that the tarball file has a 512-byte header followed by the file’s contents. We also know that beginning byte 124 there are 12 bytes of the file size in octal:

% ccxxd -s 124 -l 12 files.tar
0000007c: 3030 3030 3030 3030 3032 3020            00000000020 
So we know the first file starts at byte 512 and is 16 bytes long. We can therefore see the contents if we seek to offset 512 and check the following 16 bytes of the tarball:

% ccxxd -s 512 -l 16 files.tar
00000200: 4669 6c65 2031 2063 6f6e 7465 6e74 730a  File 1 contents.
Step 5
In this step your goal is to support the ability to revert a hex dump back to a binary file. This is the -r option. In the example below I convert the binary for the build your own shell coding challenge, ccsh to a hex dump saved as ccsh.hex, then convert it back to binary named ccshr and run it.

% ccxxd ccsh > ccsh.hex
% ccxxd -r ccsh.hex >> ccshr
% chmod u+x ccshr 
% ./ccshr
ccsh>  
Going Further
You can take this challenge further by adding support for the other options for xxd, or by using it to learn more about some of the binary files on your system. For example what files start like this (there is a different answer for each line):

00000000: cafebabe                             ....
